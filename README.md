# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software developer at the Douglas Research Centre, where I lead the development of [OpenDataCapture](https://opendatacapture.org), an open-source, web-based platform for clinical research data collection.

## My Programming Journey

I first discovered my love of programming in 2020 as an undergraduate student at McGill University, where I was studying in the research-intensive Honors Psychology program. My initial exposure was through doing statistical analysis in R, but I quickly realized that I enjoyed the programming aspect much more than the stats or research. This led me to develop an R package, [MplusLGM](https://github.com/joshunrau/MplusLGM), to automate all aspects of our analysis. As I become more interested in machine learning, I learned Python and developed [civetqc](https://github.com/joshunrau/civetqc), a command-line tool for automating quality control of neuroimaging data, an aspect of neuroscience research that I found to be unbearably tedious. After graduating, I landed a summer job that got me started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was my first step into web development, and it really opened my eyes to the possibilities in this space. Now, I'm pretty comfortable with the JavaScript ecosystem and have started picking up Rust, which has been a great experience so far.

## My Role and Philosophy

In my current role, I'm involved in everything from frontend and backend development to database management and deployment. I'm really passionate about open-source technology, but I think it takes more than just attracting people like me for it to succeed. Open source needs to be user-friendly and actually enjoyable to use. My approach to development is deeply rooted in the philosophy of making technology intuitive and accessible for everyone.

## My Tech Stack

- **Primary Language**: TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, Astro
- **Backend**: NestJS, Express, Prisma, MongoDB
- **Other**: Docker, Linux, Python, Rust (Beginner)

## Personal Projects

I have a variety of small packages to solve various problems I have encountered over the years. I also run a server hosting my personal website and various open-source services.
