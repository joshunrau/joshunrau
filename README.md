# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software developer at the Douglas Research Centre, where I lead the development of [OpenDataCapture](https://opendatacapture.org), an open-source, web-based platform for clinical research data collection.

## My Programming Journey

I began my programming journey in 2020 as an undergraduate student in the research-intensive Honors Psychology program at McGill University. My interest in programming began with statistical analysis using R, leading me to create the R package [MplusLGM](https://github.com/joshunrau/MplusLGM). Later, I learned Python and delved into basic machine learning. This led to the development of [civetqc](https://github.com/joshunrau/civetqc), a command-line tool for automating neuroimaging data quality control with scikit-learn.

Post-graduation, I ventured into web development during a short summer job. This experience was a crash course in the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, laying the foundation for my current role. Here, I've embraced the world of web development, expanding my expertise in both frontend and backend technologies.

## My Role and Philosophy

In my current position, I handle everything from frontend to backend development, database management, deployment using Docker, and continuous integration. I am deeply passionate about open-source technology, but I believe its success depends on more than just appealing to developers. For open-source to truly thrive, it needs to be user-friendly and enjoyable. My approach to development is deeply rooted in the philosophy of making technology intuitive and accessible for everyone.

## My Tech Stack

- **Primary Language**: TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, Astro
- **Backend**: NestJS, Express, Prisma, MongoDB
- **Other**: Docker, Linux, Python

## Personal Projects

I have a variety of small packages to solve various problems I have encountered over the years. I also run a server hosting my personal website and various open-source services.
