# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software developer at the Douglas Research Centre, where I lead the development of [OpenDataCapture](https://opendatacapture.org), an open-source, web-based platform for clinical research data collection.

## My Programming Journey

I began my programming journey in 2020 as an undergraduate student in the research-intensive Honors Psychology program at McGill University. I first discovered my passion for programming when I started doing statistical analysis using R, leading me to create the R package [MplusLGM](https://github.com/joshunrau/MplusLGM). Later, I learned Python and delved into basic machine learning. This led to the development of [civetqc](https://github.com/joshunrau/civetqc), a command-line tool for automating neuroimaging data quality control with scikit-learn. After graduation, I got into web development during a short summer job, where I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and started falling into the rabbit hole of the ecosystem. 

## My Role and Philosophy

In my current position, I handle everything from frontend to backend development, database management, deployment using Docker, and continuous integration. I am deeply passionate about open-source technology, but I believe its success depends on more than just appealing to developers. For open-source to truly thrive, it needs to be user-friendly and enjoyable. My approach to development is deeply rooted in the philosophy of making technology intuitive and accessible for everyone.

## My Tech Stack

- **Primary Language**: TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, Astro
- **Backend**: NestJS, Express, Prisma, MongoDB
- **Other**: Docker, Linux, Python, Rust (Beginner)

## Personal Projects

I have a variety of small packages to solve various problems I have encountered over the years. I also run a server hosting my personal website and various open-source services.
