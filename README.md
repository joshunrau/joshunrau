# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am the lead software developer for the Douglas Neuroinformatics Platform. Currently, I lead the development of Open Data Capture, a web-based platform for clinical research data collection. I developed the application from the group up, which included designing a complex architecture supporting an external gateway service, a type-safe declarative form system with support for dynamic conditional fields, and a custom instrument runtime based on dynamic import and native ES modules. More recently, I implemented a browser-based IDE with live reloading, TypeScript/JSX support, and full intellisense, using a custom esbuild-based toolchain directly in the browser (via WebAssembly).

I specialize in TypeScript for full-stack development. On the front end, I use React with TailwindCSS for styling and Astro for static site generation. For the backend, I have experience with NestJS and Express. I have experience with Linux, Docker, Git/GitHub Actions for version control and CI/CD, and Storybook for UI component development and testing.
